The following reposotory showcases our project for the hackathon where uses of all ages can sign up 
and create an account. After doing so, they can check out a few exercises and our program will inform
the user if their form is correct (green) or wrong (red). Users can check real time progress per exercise by 
viewing the point system that checks for proper posture every 5 seconds.

To run the following site, run "npm run both" to run both the backend server (openpose) and our nextjs server.
If you would like to just run the openpose server run "npm run pose" and if you wanted just the nextjs 
development server run "npm run dev".
